If you havent created your new theme folder in your WordPress Installation run these command's in the terminal:

    $ cd myProject/wp-content/themes
    $ git clone git@github.com:stevengeorgeharris/matter.git .


After cloning this repository, `cd` to the directory where you cloned the repository into, you can run this command in the terminal:

    $ cd path/to/my/project/

This should install the required `node_modules`, download the required dependencies,  compile the assets, and afterwards, start watching for changes.
